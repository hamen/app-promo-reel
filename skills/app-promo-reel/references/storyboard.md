# Storyboard — bars, scenes, variants

## Structure (30 s, ~120 bpm, 15 bars)

| Bars | Scene (template id) | Job |
|---|---|---|
| 0-1 | s1 hook | the full hook (4 words) is static and opaque from frame 0, with a beat punch on beats 0 of bars 0 and 1; one real app item card slides in |
| 2-5 | s2 the app | phone with two rebuilt screens; rows pop on beats; a tap on beat 3 |
| 6-7 | s3 the drop | the strongest real feature, slammed on the drop downbeat, flash + shake |
| 8-9 | s4 benefits | three short true benefits, one per half bar |
| 10-11 | s5 value | a two-part value word, a true one-line claim |
| 12-end | s6 end card | icon, name, tagline, CTA, only the stores the app is on, URL |

## Shot list

Each project has a `shotlist.md`: one row per scene, with the scene id (`s1`, not `s1 hook`), its
purpose, its entry state and its exit state. The Job column above is where the purposes start.
If you cannot say why a scene exists, it does not belong in the render. `build.py` fails when a
live scene has no row, when a row has no scene, or when a cell is empty or `TODO`. When you add,
remove or rename a scene, edit its row. Never delete `shotlist.md`: the check runs only while the
file exists.

| scene | purpose | entry state | exit state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| s3 | The drop: the strongest real feature | The phone has left and the word is hidden | The word is settled after the flash |

Rules:
- Frame 0 already shows the hook text or UI: feeds use it as the thumbnail. No fade in from an
  empty background (finish.py warns "frame 0 is blank").
- Every change lands on a beat. Words slam on downbeats or beat 2. Scene cuts start ~0.3 s
  before a downbeat so the new scene is settled on it.
- 16:9 hero: no beats and no bars. Time the scenes in seconds with `{{calc DURATION*x}}`; see `hero.md`.
- 4:5 feed: a feed video starts muted. Every claim and every step is on screen as text; nothing
  depends on the sound (a sound effect can stress a word, never carry it).
- One idea per scene. Text a viewer must read stays readable long enough to read it: the rule is
  in "Reading time" below.
- A different tempo means a different bar count: re-map the scenes, never squeeze text.
  The template's last lines (store badges, URL) enter on D(13, 3) and need 1.1 s to settle
  and be read: with a 30 s video that is about 116 bpm or faster (the first downbeat
  moves it a little). A slower seed fails the build with the re-map message.
  build.py fails when a scene would start less than 2 s before the end of the video.

## Feed safe zones

A feed draws its own buttons, caption and progress bar over the video. On a settled frame, keep
every text a viewer must read and every key action (a tap, a button, a counter) inside the box.
The stage, a bleed, a background and the bezel of the phone may cross it. Text in motion may cross
a line: nothing can be read while it moves.

| Format | The box (px of the frame) | Text, as rendered |
|---|---|---|
| 9:16 | top 270, right 120, bottom 420, left 64: x 64-960, y 270-1500 | 32 px or more |
| 4:5 | top 96, right 64, bottom 96, left 64: x 64-1016, y 96-1254 | 30 px or more |
| 16:9 hero | no box (a web page, not a feed) | no minimum |

- Text in a scaled element counts at its rendered size: the 4:5 phone is scaled 0.79, so its 38 px
  text shows at 30 px.
- The AI-generated label sits at the bottom-left corner of the box (9:16: y 1430-1492, 32 px; 4:5:
  y 1186-1246, 30 px). Keep that corner free of text in every scene.
- Long captions or a paid post: use the strict 9:16 box (bottom 672, right 192) when the user asks
  for it. It is an option the user names, not the default.
- Put the visual mass near the middle of the box (y 885 in 9:16), not at its top. Do not leave the
  lower 40% of the box empty.
- The check command that `build.py` prints makes the bottom of the box an error band, read at the
  settled times (1.1 s after each scene starts and 0.5 s before its window ends). The top and the
  right edge are not checked by a script: look at the stills.

## Density

Nothing on screen stays still for more than 0.8 s, except the end card, which may hold up to
2.5 s. A still that is a choice (a freeze on a hit) lasts 0.25 s or less. A text that holds stays
put while something else moves: a punch on the next beat, a pulse, a row that pops.
`finish.py` warns `still for <length> s from <time> s: nothing on screen moves (look at it)` for
each longer still run (9:16 and 4:5). It measures the whole frame, so a visible background pulse
counts as motion: whether the foreground alone is too static is the critique's call.

## Reading time

A text the viewer must read needs max(0.8 s, 0.3 s per word) of readable time: 0.8 s for a short
label, 0.3 s per word for a longer line (4 words: 1.2 s). Its time is its longest run of readable
frames. Mark each such text with the `data-read` attribute. The template marks its 17 captions: the
hook, the two captions of s2, the feature and its three lines, the three benefits and their line, the
value words and their line, the name, the tagline and the CTA. UI to glance at is not marked: the
phone's rows, the hero card, the store badges, the URL, the AI-generated label.

`read_check.py <project>` (9:16 and 4:5, after build.py) seeks the page frame by frame. A text is
readable at a frame when:
- the frame is inside its scene's time;
- the text and each element inside it that holds a word of its own are shown: no `display: none`,
  `visibility` visible, opacity 0.9 or more along the way up to the scene, no blur over 2 px, not cut
  by a `clip-path` or by a box whose `overflow` is not `visible` (an `inset()` clip is measured; any
  other clip shape counts as cut);
- the box of its text is inside its scene's box.

Words are counted with the browser's word breaker in the page's language, so a language with no spaces
counts words too. A short text gets one line, for example:
`warning: reading time: #cap-b "Step two" (2 words) is readable for 0.6 s from 9.3 s; it needs 0.8 s`.
The warning never fails the run: the critique decides (`references/critique.md`).

The usual cause is a late entrance in the scene. The fixes: enter earlier, use fewer words, or give the
scene more time (re-map the bars). A punch or a pulse on a held text does not stop its time: the text
stays readable. The stock template passes at 120 bpm; `#fl-2` and `#ben-line` sit on the limit
(3 words, 0.9 s) and warn at a faster tempo.

## Drop placement

The drop bar is chosen in the storyboard first (template: bar 6). Then:
- If the chosen seed has a detected lift (`lift_at` in the rank table) on a downbeat in bars
  4-8, move the storyboard's drop to that bar.
- Otherwise build a synthetic lift: `make_bed.py --drop-bar <drop bar>`, so the full band hits
  on the drop downbeat. The riser tail comes from the `riser` cue in cues.json.

## Hook / angle menu (one per variant, never repeat)

1. **The problem, in the viewer's words** — "FORGOT IT / IN THE BACK / OF THE FRIDGE?"
2. **The moment of use** — the single screen people open the app for, from second one.
3. **Before → after** — the messy way, then the app's way (only if the app shows both).
4. **The one feature** — the most distinctive real feature as the hook.
5. **Question to the viewer** — "STILL DOING X BY HAND?"
6. **Speed** — how few taps the core action takes (count them in the real app).
7. **For who** — families / students / a hobby, if the listing names that audience.

Colour mood per variant: e.g. brand colour vs a light surface vs a warm accent — always from
DESIGN.md colours.

## SFX (cues.json)

Whoosh into each scene cut, impact on slams, pop on items, click on taps, chime on the value
line, a riser tail ending on the drop (`"align": "end"`), a big impact on the drop and the logo.
Keep volumes 0.25-0.85; the drop and the logo loudest.

A cue's `at` is when the sound is HEARD: build.py skips the leading silence of each file
(`"align": "attack"`, the default). Many stock SFX start with 50-400 ms of silence; without
this, a pop on the beat sounds a tenth of a second late.

finish.py checks every cue and fails on one it cannot find in the final audio ("masked").
A cue placed under a louder sound on purpose (a pop inside the drop's impact tail, a spark
under a whoosh) cannot be checked: mark it `"sync": false` with a `"why"` in cues.json. The
template's cues.json already marks the ones it layers.
